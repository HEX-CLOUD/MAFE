# MAFE — Multi-Agent Feature Engineering Framework

MAFE is a **research-oriented multi-agent system (MAS)** that automates
feature engineering for tabular machine learning tasks while ensuring
feature quality, efficiency, and fairness.

This project evaluates how specialized agents can collaboratively
improve model performance over traditional manual feature engineering.

---

## 🔬 Problem Motivation

Feature engineering is:

- time-consuming
- highly heuristic
- prone to target leakage

MAFE addresses this by introducing **autonomous agents** that:

- generate features
- coordinate selection
- prune redundancy
- detect leakage

All improvements are **empirically validated**.

## 🧠 System Architecture

MAFE consists of the following agents:

| Agent                   | Responsibility             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Transformation Agent    | Non-linear transformations |
| Interaction Agent       | Feature interactions       |
| Coordinator Agent       | Feature budget enforcement |
| Pruner Agent            | Feature quality control    |
| Leakage Detection Agent | Prevents target leakage    |
